        "(Fun_Math)^2 is a simple math game where user need to guess the correct length perfect square given the prefix. There are basically three rounds.\n\n"
        "First Round:\n"
        "User need to guess 5 different perfect squares of length 3 given a prefix of length 2."
        "If user is able to guess the correct square then"
        "he wins and press next to continue\n\n"
        "Second Round:\n"
        "Here the user need to guess 5 different perfect squares of length 4 given a prefix of length 2.\n\n"
        "Third Round:\n"
        "Here the user need to guess 5 different perfect squares of length 5 given a prefix of length 2.\n\n"
        "Entering \"SOLVE\" at any stage leads to display of the appropriate perfect Square.\n\n"
